# NestJS and TypeORM with JSON Web Token (JWT) Authentication

This project is intended to be a starter template for people trying to get authentication working on with NestJS.

## Authentication

In a literal sense, "authentication" refers to the act of proving some assertion, whether it be the identity of a person or the user of a computer system. It is not necessarily the process of identifying whatever the credentials may be but rather the process of verifying them.

With the power of authentication, we can have things like permissions and guards that serve to prevent users who are not authorized or who are forbidden towards committing certain actions or having access to particular pages. There are multiple ways of implementing this and one of them involves a protocol called the "JSON Web Token" or JWT.
